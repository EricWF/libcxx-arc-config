minRunners: 0

# If you need to do maintaince or drain a group of runners, update the
# runner group with maxRunners: 0 and let the pending jobs finish.
#
# When omitted entirely, the maximum number of runners is limited by the number
# of nodes kubernetes can create.
#
# While that keeps the limit better in-step with resource allocation limits
# it may make scheduling harder when there are more than one cluster involved.
# maxRunners: 4

# This runner group name must be unique and must already exist in the LLVM
# organization. The github app keyfiles have sufficient permission to use the
# github API's to create these runner group names.
